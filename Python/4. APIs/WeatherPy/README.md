# Python-API Assignment

This repository uses the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Using the Python libraries Pandas and Matplotlibs, a script was created to build a series of scatter plots of cities to showcase the following relationships:
  - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
